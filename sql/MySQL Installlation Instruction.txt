	[mysqld]
	# set basedir to your installation path
	basedir=C:\mysql-5.7.19

Step 5: start service and login with root
step 6: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'root';
step 7: flush privileges;
step 8: create database quizgendb;
step 9: create user 'quizgen'@'localhost' identified by 'quizgen';
step 10: grant all on quizgendb.* to 'quizgen'@'localhost';
